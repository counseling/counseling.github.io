<p><strong>Activities</strong>: The activities folder includes activities which can be employed for peer-group counseling sessions for orphaned and vulnerable children. The activities included here have been screened for cultural fit for <strong>East Africa</strong>, specifically Uganda. However, they may be adaptable to different regions.</p>

<p> The activities folder includes the following documents:
<ul>
<li> The Hero Book </li>
<li>Treatment for AIDS-oprhans in Malawi</li>
<li>Treating Trauma and Traumatic Grief in Children and Adolescents / Edition 1</li>
</ul>

For more information on the activities in each document see
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlR6AVh-GUVndDM3QkpYUG4wcTdTclFYZHVpUTB2dHc&usp=drive_web#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a></p>

<p>In addition to these activities, we have curated a <strong>one-year</strong> curriculum for counseling programs. You can find this resource under "Guided Curriculum." </p>

<p>One of the most interesting and engaging activities included in the activities folder and in the guided curriculum is the hero book. Below you will find a short introduction to the Hero Book</p>

<p><strong>Manuals</strong>: You will also see a list of training documents available for download. We made an effort to only include training documents that were developed for individuals with a limited background in formal counseling training</p>
<ul>
<li> Psychosocial Support Training Manual. Developed for use in Zimbabwe </li>
<li> Counseling. UNESCO Training Package for Counselors </li>
<li> The Psychosocial Care and Protection of Children in Emergencies</li>
</ul>

<p>It is incredibly important that we measure the impact of counseling programs aimed at orphaned and vulnerable children, so that we may shape interventions based on empirical data. However, we also understand that many interventions are operating in a resource-limited environment and are unable to implement a randomized control trial. </p>

<p>In Evaluation Framework you will find materials for program evaluations that have been developed specifically for use in resource limited environments</p>

<p>Additionally, we recommend that programs use one of the following tools to measure child well-being:

<ul>
<li>Children’s Depression Inventory </li>
<li>Beck Youth Inventory</li>
<li>Becks’s Hopeless Scale </li>
<li>Acholi Psychosocial Assessment Instrument Depression Problems Subscale </li>
<li> Clinician Administered PTSD Scale </li>
<li> Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview </li>
</ul>
