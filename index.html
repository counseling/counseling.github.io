<p>It's incredibly important that we measure the impact of counseling programs aimed at orphaned and vulnerable children, so that we may shape interventions based on empirical data. However, we also understand that many interventions are operating in a resource-limited environment and are unable to implement a randomized control trial. </p>

<p>In ___ you will find  materials for program evaluations that have been developed specifically for use in resource limited environments</p>

<p>Additionally, we recommend that programs use one of the following tools to measure child well-being:
      * Children’s Depression Inventory 
      * Beck Youth Inventory 
      * Becks’s Hopeless Scale 
      * Acholi Psychosocial Assessment Instrument Depression Problems Subscale 
      * Clinician Administered PTSD Scale
      * Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview </p>
