<p><strong>Activities</strong>: In _______ you will find a list of ___ activities which can be employed for peer-group counseling sessions for orphaned and vulnerable children. The activities included here have been screened for cultural fit for East Africa, specifically Uganda. However, they may be adaptable to different regions.</p>

<p>Additionally, we have included a number of stand-alone resources you may choose from at your discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Trainings</strong>: You will also see a list of training documents available for download. We have ordered these documents based on perceived quality. We made an effort to only include training documents that were developed for individuals with a limited background in formal counseling training</p>

<p>It's incredibly important that we measure the impact of counseling programs aimed at orphaned and vulnerable children, so that we may shape interventions based on empirical data. However, we also understand that many interventions are operating in a resource-limited environment and are unable to implement a randomized control trial. </p>

<p>In ___ you will find materials for program evaluations that have been developed specifically for use in resource limited environments</p>

<p>Additionally, we recommend that programs use one of the following tools to measure child well-being:
      * Children’s Depression Inventory
      * Beck Youth Inventory
      * Becks’s Hopeless Scale
      * Acholi Psychosocial Assessment Instrument Depression Problems Subscale
      * Clinician Administered PTSD Scale
      * Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview </p>
