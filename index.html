<ul>
<li> Activities to implement during the session</li>
<li> The expected time per activity </li>
<li> Location of the resource </li>
<li> Objectives of the session </li>

</ul>

<a name="Researchers: Evaluation Frameworks, Results, and Discussion" class="anchor" href="#researchers"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Researchers</h3>

<p> Organizations that provide counseling for orphans and vulnerable children face a major obstacle with regards to evaluation: how can the groups know if their programs are improving children’s psychosocial well-being?  Program evaluations are useful for such organizations in designing interventions and attracting funding.  <a href=" https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B19qdjOVMvtXcHBiZWV2SGY4TFE/edit?usp=sharing ">This document </a> provides a framework that seeks to evaluate the efficacy of peer group counseling sessions at relatively low cost.  </p>

<p> In the interest of containing costs, this framework does not use randomized evaluation.  If an organization has a large research budget, we recommend using a randomized evaluation instead as it can more convincingly identify the causal influence of counseling on child well-being.   </p>

<p> Our framework uses a modified Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to gauge child wellbeing.  The following metrics can also be used if evaluators feel they are better suited for a particular context:   </p>

<ul>
<li>Children’s Depression Inventory </li>
<li>Beck Youth Inventory</li>
<li>Becks’s Hopeless Scale </li>
<li>Acholi Psychosocial Assessment Instrument Depression Problems Subscale </li>
<li> Clinician Administered PTSD Scale </li>
<li> Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview </li>
</ul>
